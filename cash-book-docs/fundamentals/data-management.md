# Data Management

CashBook is converting book entries into any supported export format. You start by creating a data framework of dependencies between accounts, templates with transactions. Then you create book entries from that data. And finally you export your data and give it to your accountant or upload it to Datev by yourself.

Currently we only support importing and exporting backups and datev exports for days and months.
