# Roadmap

CashBook is in a very early stage. By the time you are reading this we probably  finished our alpha testing phase and are now in the beta testing phase. When beta is finished we will find more customers and launch a Pro version of cashBook and scale the application horizontally and vertically.

We at cashBook believe in high value of User feedback and thereby user driven development. We hope that our user will give us as much feedback as they can so that we can render the common feature requests from it and let the users lead the development process towards customer satifaction.

#### Possible Features

Things that we are looking into. This is not a commitment to develop these possible features, but more of an inspiration for our users.

* Multilanguage support(DE, EN)
* User accounts & Permissions
* Data persitence accros all devices&#x20;
* Native App(iOS, Andoid, Mac, PC)
* Automatic upload to Datev, accountant, tax attorney
